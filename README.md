# Coffee Orders Data Transformation and Analysis Using Excel

## Overview:
This is an end-to-end Excel project involving a dataset of coffee orders. Key functions used for data transformation include XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, multiplication, and IF statements. The data was cleaned by formatting dates, numbers, and removing duplicates. Pivot tables and charts were then used to create a dynamic coffee sales dashboard.
